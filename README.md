**Where Data set can be found**  
You can find the data set in [Data set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) or download from the repository. The description of the data can be found here [Data Description](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
**Files**  
1. *CodeBook.md* is a code book where the variables, the data and transformations and work that I made to clean the data is described.  
2. *run_analysis.R* show the code that transform the data acording with the course project's definition as in the following lines: 
      + 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
      + 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
      + 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  
      + 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
      + 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  
3. *TidyData.txt* is the final data in a tidy format asked by the course project.
